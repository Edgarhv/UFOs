## Overview
I made a more Dynamic webpage for Dana because she wanted a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In order to create a better web page I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the spaceship.

## Results

In this first image, we can see a web page interactive but not dynamic.

In the picture above, we can see that the web page has different filters because we can find the criteria that we are looking for, and shows the information at the moment. Finally, this web page is dynamic and interactive.

## Summary
Finally, this new page is more Dynamic because you have filters, and you can find information depends on what do you want to find but like users, if you don't know the criteria the web page is not useful.

###### Recommendations for further development:
######  -For a better function of a web page, I would like to create a button to display the different criteria of the filters.
######  -I would like to improve the background of the webpage to look more professional.
